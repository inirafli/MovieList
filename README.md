# MovieList

The MovieList app is created as part of the 'Fundamental FE' course on Dicoding. It allows users to browse and discover information about movies. The movie data is sourced from **TheMovieDB** API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have obtained an API key from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and replace the `API_KEY` variable in the code with your own API key.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/inirafli/MovieList.git
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server, use the following command:

```shell
npm run start-dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode.

Alternatively, you can build and run the production-ready app:

```shell
npm run build
npm start
```

This will build and serve the optimized production version of the app.
